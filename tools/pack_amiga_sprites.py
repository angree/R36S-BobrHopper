Input is what apps/sw_bake_amiga.cpp produced: one RGBA PNG per sprite plus sprites.txt
(name rot phase w h anchorX anchorY).

Output:
  <out>/sprites.spr    one file, BIG-ENDIAN, loaded with a single read into fast RAM
  <header>             generated C header: one enum constant per sprite, so the game never
                       looks anything up by string at runtime

Format of sprites.spr (all multi-byte fields big-endian, so the 68k does no swapping at all -
the same trick Amiga_GTA uses for its .til files):

    0  char[4]  'BHSP'
    4  u16      version (1)
    6  u16      sprite count
    8  u16      palette entries used (<= 256)
   10  u16      reserved (0)
   12  u8[768]  palette, RGB triples; entry 0 is the transparent key and is never drawn
  780  entries[count], 12 bytes each:
           u16 w, u16 h, i16 anchorX, i16 anchorY, u32 pixelOffset
  ...  pixel data, w*h bytes per sprite, one palette index per pixel, 0 = transparent

Palette: the art is flat-coloured (.fmesh carries one colour per triangle), so the exact set of
colours is small and is used as-is when it fits. If it ever does not fit, the rarest colours are
merged into their nearest neighbour - reported, never silent.

# and the sky have their own fixed indices so the Amiga shows the console versions' colours. Those COLOURS are
# pinned. The art is free to draw WITH them - that is the difference from the 256-colour sets, where art was kept
# out of the reserved indices as a tidiness rule that cost two entries out of 256 and would cost twenty out of 64.

#   - the beaver's brown (633C21) and the log's (734131) are close enough that the fit merged them into one
#     pen, so the animal was exactly the colour of the thing it stands on and vanished into it.
