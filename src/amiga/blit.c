/* The masked blit. See blit.h for why this is allowed to be so plain.
 *
 * Two rules carried over from the sibling ports' renderers, both about the inner loop:
 *   - CLIP BY MOVING THE START, not by testing inside the loop. A sprite hanging off the left edge has its source
 *     pointer and width adjusted once, before the rows begin.
 *   - NOTHING IN THE INNER LOOP MAY TOUCH A STRUCT through a pointer. gcc 6.5 at -O1 reloads struct fields on every
 *     iteration when it cannot prove they did not change, so pitch and width are copied into locals first. The GTA
 *     port measured this as a real cost, not a theoretical one.
