// The Amiga game: shared logic, sprites instead of polygons (tasks F1 + D3 + E3).
//
// The whole port rests on one property of the original: the camera is ORTHOGRAPHIC and never rotates, and
// Game::forwardScene slides the WORLD rather than the camera. So an object's size on screen never changes, one baked
// picture per model is correct everywhere, and placing it costs a linear transform - no perspective divide, no
// scaling, no depth buffer.
//
// What is shared with SF2000/R36S: everything under src/game (movement, collisions, map generation, scoring), built
// with CR_FIXED so every number is 16.16 - no float or double reaches this CPU, which has no FPU.
// What is ours: this file, the blitter, the sprite container, the sound player and the platform layer.
//
// NO AMIGA <proto/*> HEADERS IN THIS FILE. That rule is inherited from the OpenTTD port ("that collision is what
// sank the previous attempt") and this file proved it again: including <proto/dos.h> made `Node` stop resolving to
// the game's scene node and made `Input` ambiguous against AmigaDOS's BPTR Input(VOID). Everything the Amiga side
// needs arrives through headers that are deliberately free of Amiga types.
//
// Deliberately NOT used here: std::sort. The toolchain's inliner segfaults inside bits/stl_heap.h on this target, so
// the painter's order uses an insertion sort over a few dozen items - which is also the right algorithm for a list
// that is nearly sorted every frame.

        // - the z column is the RAW eye vector, never normalised, and normalize() only returns its input

        // this same file, got all of them right to a few raw 16.16 units. So the maths is sound and the INLINED
        // function is miscompiled: gcc 6.5.0b on m68k at -O1, which has already produced two internal compiler
        // errors on this project.
        //
        // Doing it as named locals, one operation per statement, is the pattern the probe proved works. It also
        // keeps full precision rather than hard-coding the measured basis as constants.

        // Measured, not assumed: a runtime probe (values passed through volatile, so the compiler could not fold
        // them) returned rsqrt(17.25) = 0 AND rsqrt(4.0) = 0. Every input, not just awkward ones. fixedSqrt starts
        // with `uint64_t bit = 1 << 46` and then `while (bit > n) bit >>= 2;` - if that 64-bit shift or compare
        // misbehaves here, bit is zero, the loop never runs and the function returns zero, which is precisely what
